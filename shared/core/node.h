/**
 * @file node.h
 * @brief Node state machine interface for self-organizing microcontrollers
 *
 * This header defines the core node data structures and API for implementing
 * a distributed coordinator election and member management system. The design
 * is completely platform-agnostic with zero preprocessor conditionals.
 *
 * Key Concepts:
 * - Nodes start in SEEKING state and either become COORDINATOR or MEMBER
 * - Coordinator election uses random nonces for tie-breaking
 * - Members retry JOIN requests until they receive an ID assignment
 * - All communication happens through the abstract bus interface
